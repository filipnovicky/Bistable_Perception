# Bistable_Perception

A depository for the paper: Bistable perception, precision and neuromodulation. 
In this project we studied a combination of three precision terms that have previously been linked to neuromodulatory activity in an agent looking at a bistable perception figure of a Necker cube

The DEM_bistable_perception_main.m file contains the main analysis of all the precision term combinations. The model itself can be found in generate_mdp_bistable_perception.m. The algorithm of counting a switch is in switcher_bistable_perception.m. Finally, the figures are in files bistable_perception_figures4and5.m and Figures5andS1.ipynb. The latter code is written in python and requires data from data.csv and tab_bistable.csv which is the saved output of the analysis.

For running this model it is necessary to download the SPM12 file from https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/
